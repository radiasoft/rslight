# Machine Learning
Machine learning calculations for the blicon SBIR project.
Synchrotron radiation beamlines are modeled in SRW and Shadow.
Training data is created by running over a range of errors
such as misalignments. ML models are trained to reconstruct
errors and optimize radiation at various diagnostics and at sample.
